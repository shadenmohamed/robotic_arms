The LittleArm 2C is designed to be the kit that kids can easily use so that STEM classes can implement more robotics curriculum. It has been made more rugged and much easier to put together, so that it is easy for kids to use.
All the parts can be easily 3D printed, and are designed to keep the arm sleek and simple. The entire design has less than 15 screws.
To control the arm you can either use our Windows application (which was originally written in Python code here) or through Bluetooth with the Android App that we made for it
